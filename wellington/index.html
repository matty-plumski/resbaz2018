        <div>
          <expandable-heading title="Data & Narratives">
      Data visualisation for communication is a bit different from exploratory data analysis. In this workshop led by Harkanwal Sign, we will explore examples of compelling data narratives and what makes visualisation work for the audience. Also, the workshop will focus on the design process outside of the code, including sketching data visualisation and learning how to use colour better.
    </expandable-heading>
     <expandable-heading title="Introduction to Data Visualization and Effective Use of Visual Variables">
     Data visualization is an important tool for the 21st century, assisting in both data analysis and the communication of results. The use of appropriate visualization techniques can greatly increase the ability to gain insight from data. This workshop will give an introduction to data visualization using different tools and techniques, and use of visual variables to make effective visualizations. Come prepared with your own datasets that you want to visualize!
    </expandable-heading>
    <expandable-heading title="Introduction to Video Abstracts">
